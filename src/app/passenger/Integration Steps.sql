UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-admin@email.com';

Install the chat component in your ride details or sidebar:

jsx// In your ride component
<TriGoChat 
  supabase={supabase}
  currentUser={user}
  rideId={ride.id}
  otherUser={otherParticipant}
  isAdmin={user.role === 'admin'}
/>

jsx// In your admin dashboard
<AdminChatManager 
  supabase={supabase}
  adminUser={adminUser}
/>
Key Features

Real-time messaging between riders and drivers
Admin oversight - can read all chats and delete messages
Automatic chat room creation when a ride is booked
Message history stored permanently (unless deleted by admin)
